# Project goal
- This [wine data](tps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv), has features `fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality`. Build a random forest model to predict the wine quality using random forest with one third of the features at every split.

# Solution
[python code](./wine-quality-random-forest.py)
